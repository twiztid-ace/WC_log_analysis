# pull_top100_druid.ps1
#
# Fully self-contained: pulls the Top 100 Restoration Druid rankings for every SSC/TK boss,
# then pulls the FULL set of per-parse data for every one of those 1000 parses:
#   - healing events   (COMPLETE per-spell + per-target healing breakdown, via
#                        /report/events/healing/ with sourceid= - see below for why this
#                        replaced the healing TABLE)
#   - casts events     (COMPLETE cooldown/utility/consumable casts, each with a real
#                        target, via /report/events/casts/ with sourceid= - replaced the
#                        casts TABLE for the same reason. Consumables like mana potions/
#                        Dark Runes still show up here as cast events too.)
#   - buffs            (flask/food active-at-pull-start + real Tree of Life uptime %,
#                        replaces the old buffs TABLE, which was found to merge every
#                        Druid's buffs in a fight into one flat list - see "Buff uptime
#                        redesign" below)
#   - deaths           (fight-wide, NOT class-scoped - table view, UNCHANGED, pulled once
#                        per unique report+fight, not once per parse)
#
# ============================================================================
# ACTIVE/ARCHIVED DIFF MODEL (2026-07-12) - replaces the old date-stamped-folder approach
# ============================================================================
# Every run used to create a brand new data\Classes\Druid\{date}\ folder and re-fetch all
# ~1000 parses from scratch, even though the vast majority of a boss's Top 100 doesn't
# change between runs and a completed log's healing/casts/consumables data can never
# change once pulled. That's pure wasted API budget (WCL caps at 800 calls/hour - see the
# PARALLELIZED note below). This version instead:
#   1. Reads data\Classes\Druid\manifest.json (per-boss lastPulledDate/rankingsSnapshotDate,
#      per-parse status "active"/"archived" keyed by "{reportID}_{fightID}_{playerName}").
#   2. Fetches fresh rankings for a boss (1 call, same as before) and diffs the fresh
#      reportID+fightID+name set against the manifest's currently-active parses for that
#      boss:
#        - present in fresh, NOT in manifest-active -> genuinely new, fetch its full data
#          (this is the only case that costs real per-parse API calls)
#        - present in BOTH -> still in the Top 100, zero API calls - just refresh its
#          rank/hps in the manifest from the response we already have in memory
#        - in manifest-active, NOT in fresh -> dropped out of the Top 100 - move its
#          healing/casts/consumables files from active\{Boss}\ to archived\{Boss}\ (kept
#          forever, not deleted) and flip its manifest status to "archived"
#   3. The on-disk rankings_{boss}.json under active\ only gets overwritten - and the
#      PREVIOUS version archived to archived\rankings_history\{Boss}\{old date}.json -
#      when that diff found at least one add or drop. A pure rank/HPS reshuffle among the
#      same 100 people (which shouldn't really happen for completed logs, but just in
#      case) does NOT trigger a rewrite/archive - only real membership changes do. This
#      means the on-disk rankings_{boss}.json can very slightly lag the manifest's
#      per-parse rank/hps fields in that edge case - the manifest is always the source of
#      truth for those, the JSON file is a periodic snapshot, not a live mirror.
#   4. `deaths.json` files are NEVER archived, regardless of whether the parse(s) that
#      reference them get archived - they're tiny, fight-wide (not per-parse), and
#      cheap to just leave in active\{Boss}\ forever.
#   5. lastPulledDate/rankingsSnapshotDate are plain "yyyy-MM-dd" calendar-date strings,
#      not timestamps - staleness is ALWAYS computed by comparing to today's date, never
#      stored as a boolean (a stored true/false flag would silently go wrong the instant
#      the date rolls over). summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1 is expected to apply the same
#      rule against `benchmarkGeneratedDate` at the top of the manifest.
# Creates data\Classes\Druid\manifest.json fresh (empty bosses) if it doesn't exist yet -
# for Druid specifically, it was created once by scripts\migrate_class_to_active.ps1
# migrating the last date-folder pull (2026-07-10) into this layout; that migration
# script does NOT need to run again for Druid.
# ============================================================================
#
# ============================================================================
# PARALLELIZED (2026-07-11): per-parse work runs across multiple threads via a
# RunspacePool, since Windows PowerShell 5.1 doesn't have ForEach-Object -Parallel
# (that's PS7+ only). Read this before changing -MaxThreads:
#
# THE RATE LIMIT IS LIKELY THE REAL BOTTLENECK, NOT SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION. WCL's API
# caps at 800 calls/hour (from the X-Ratelimit-Limit response header). The OLD
# sequential script's 250ms delay already runs at ~4 calls/sec (~14,400/hour
# theoretical), far above that cap. Adding concurrency on top of an already-over-budget
# rate makes 429s more likely, not less. -MaxThreads defaults to 10 (raised from an
# initial default of 5 once real runs showed the sequential `deaths` pass - since
# folded into this same pool, see the THREAD SAFETY note below - as the actual
# bottleneck at lower thread counts, not the rate limit). If you see repeated "FAILED"
# lines mentioning 429 or rate limit, lower -MaxThreads back down. The active/archived
# diff model above should make this a smaller concern in practice anyway, since most
# runs now only fetch a handful of genuinely new parses per boss instead of all 100.
#
# THREAD SAFETY: the sequential version shared plain PowerShell hashtables
# ($fightsCache, $tableCache, $deathsPulled) across the whole run - those are NOT safe
# for concurrent writes from multiple threads. This version uses
# [System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary] instead for all of them,
# including a `$deathsClaimed` registry (2026-07-11) that runs `deaths` INSIDE the
# parallel worker too, gated by an atomic TryAdd claim: only the first thread to
# successfully claim a given "reportID|fightID" key fetches it, every other thread
# that races for the same claim gets $false back from TryAdd and skips - a real
# mutex, not just tolerating the occasional collision. (An earlier version of this
# script kept deaths in a separate sequential pass specifically to avoid this race;
# real pulled data showed ~0% report+fight sharing between parses anyway, so the
# race window was already rare in practice, but the claim-based fix removes it
# entirely rather than just relying on that low probability.) If the claiming
# thread's own fetch fails, no other thread retries it within this run - a full
# script re-run will pick it up fresh, same as any other failed call here.
#
# ============================================================================
# BUFF UPTIME REDESIGN (2026-07-11, same day as the healing/casts events rewrite)
# ============================================================================
# The old `/report/tables/buffs/{code}?sourceclass=Druid&hostility=0` call was found
# to merge every Druid in the fight into one flat list, not scoped to the one specific
# ranked player the file was named after - confirmed on real data (a single file
# showed Moonkin Form + Dire Bear Form + Tree of Life simultaneously, three different
# specs' forms, impossible for one character). Replaced with two pieces, both
# validated against real character-pull data before being adapted here:
#   - Flask/Elixir + food: pulled from the `combatantinfo` snapshot (the flat, no-
#     `{view}`-segment form of /report/events/) - these buffs last 1-2 hours, far
#     longer than a fight, so "active when the pull started" stands in for "active
#     the whole fight." combatantinfo can fire BEFORE a fight's recorded start_time
#     (confirmed: 33.6s early on a real Kael'thas pull) - the query searches a 2-
#     minute backward buffer and picks whichever snapshot is closest to start.
#   - Tree of Life: reconstructed from real apply/remove events (guid 33891 only -
#     its paired guid 34123 fires far more often in ways that don't match manual
#     form-toggling, empirically untrustworthy, excluded). Unlike the character-pull
#     script, this is scoped to just the ONE fight each parse represents, not
#     report-wide - there's no whole-raid-night amortization benefit here since every
#     parse is a different player, and we only ever need this one fight's uptime.
# See WORKFLOW.md and pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1's header for the full validation
# writeup (including why a naive "every orphan removebuff = active since window
# start" rule was wrong and had to be restricted to only the first such event).
# ============================================================================
#
# WHY HEALING/CASTS MOVED FROM TABLES TO EVENTS (2026-07-11 redesign)
# ============================================================================
# The /report/tables/{healing,casts}/{code} views silently cap their per-player
# "abilities" array at 5 entries - confirmed on Danceswtrees's real Leotheras kill
# (healing table said total=176374 but the 5 listed abilities only summed to 166830 -
# 9544 points of healing missing, no error, no warning) and on Turkeykin's real Hydross
# kill (the casts table showed 5 abilities with NO Innervate, despite Innervate
# definitely being cast that fight - confirmed via a targeted events pull with a real
# target: Turkeykin -> Churbert). /report/events/{view}/{code} with `sourceid` (a real,
# documented, standalone query param) returns complete, untruncated per-event records.
#
# DROPPED: resources / resources-gains (mana-over-time, HPM). Confirmed the real param
# name is `abilityid` (not `resourcetype`, an earlier wrong guess), untested against
# this specific endpoint as of this writing.
#
# Run this from your repo ROOT directory (e.g. C:\Users\raymo\wc_logs\), which should contain:
#   - an apikey.txt file at the root, with just your WCL API key on a single line
#     (add apikey.txt to your .gitignore so it never gets committed)
#   - a data\Classes\ folder (created automatically if it doesn't exist yet)
#
# Creates/updates: data\Classes\Druid\manifest.json
# Writes, per NEW parse only:
#   data\Classes\Druid\active\{BossName}\{reportID}_{fightID}_{playerName}_healing_events.json
#   data\Classes\Druid\active\{BossName}\{reportID}_{fightID}_{playerName}_casts_events.json
#   data\Classes\Druid\active\{BossName}\{reportID}_{fightID}_{playerName}_consumables.json
# Writes, once per unique report+fight (never archived):
#   data\Classes\Druid\active\{BossName}\{reportID}_{fightID}_deaths.json
# Moves, per DROPPED parse (no longer in the Top 100):
#   active\{BossName}\{...} -> archived\{BossName}\{...} (healing/casts/consumables only)
# Conditionally (only when a boss's Top 100 membership actually changed):
#   active\rankings_{boss}.json overwritten; previous version moved to
#   archived\rankings_history\{BossName}\{previous rankingsSnapshotDate}.json
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File pull_top100_druid.ps1
