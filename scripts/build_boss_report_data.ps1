#
# Generalizes two one-off computation scripts written by hand in an earlier session
# (compute_danceswtrees_remaining_bosses.ps1, and the ad hoc gear-diff logic used to
# build the raid overview's gear audit) into one reusable, per-character tool. Makes
# ZERO API calls and touches nothing but files already pulled to disk by
# pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1 / pull_top100_{class}.ps1 / summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1
# - this script's only job is turning those raw files into one clean JSON with every
# real number needed to author a healer's boss pages + raid overview, so nothing
# downstream (the generate-healer-report skill, or a person) has to re-read
# multi-thousand-event raw JSON or hand-compute a percentage.
#
# Usage (run from repo root, same convention as every other script here):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\build_boss_report_data.ps1 -CharacterName "Danceswtrees" -ReportCode "XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb" -ClassName "Druid"
#
# Output: data\Characters\{CharacterName}\{ReportCode}\{ReportCode}_report_data.json
# (the folder isn't a parameter - it's resolved by finding the real
# fights_{ReportCode}.json pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1 already wrote, wherever
# under that character's folder it landed, same lookup pattern that script itself
# uses for cache reuse - this also means it still works unmodified against older,
# date-named folders from before the ReportCode-keyed folder change).
