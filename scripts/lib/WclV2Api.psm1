# WclV2Api.psm1
#
# Shared OAuth2 + GraphQL helpers for Warcraft Logs' v2 API
# (https://www.warcraftlogs.com/api/v2/client), replacing the v1 REST API's
# `api_key=` query param auth. See WORKFLOW.md / the migration plan for why:
# v1's only percentile sources (/parses/character/, /rankings/character/) can't
# answer "what was this exact report+fight's percentile" - v2's
# reportData.report(code).rankings(fightIDs:[...]) can, confirmed live.
#
# Requires three files at the repo root (gitignored, same convention as
# apikey.txt): v2_client_id.txt, v2_client_secret.txt (from registering a client
# at https://www.warcraftlogs.com/api/clients/ - use a placeholder redirect URL
# like http://localhost, it's required by the form but unused by this grant
# type), and v2_access_token.txt (created automatically on first use).
#
# Usage (run from repo root, same as every other script here):
#   Import-Module (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "lib\WclV2Api.psm1") -Force
#   $result = Invoke-WclGraphQL -Query 'query { rateLimitData { limitPerHour } }'
#
# RunspacePool note: worker scriptblocks dispatched into a runspace pool do NOT
# inherit the parent session's Import-Module. Each worker must
# Import-Module this file by absolute path (passed in as an argument, same
# pattern already used for $baseUrl/$apiKey in the v1 scripts). To avoid every
# parallel worker independently reading/refreshing the token file (a needless
# race), the OUTER script should call Get-WclAccessToken ONCE and pass the
# resolved token string into each worker, which then passes it to
# Invoke-WclGraphQL via -AccessToken. Invoke-WclGraphQL still self-heals on a
# live 401 regardless (calls Get-WclAccessToken -ForceRefresh and retries once) -
# a harmless safety net even if multiple workers hit it at once, since the token
# file is small and idempotent to rewrite.

#
# CALLER GOTCHA (cost real debugging time, confirmed live - avoid repeating it):
# this function invokes $QueryBuilder via `& $QueryBuilder $startTime` from ITS
# OWN function scope. If $QueryBuilder references any variable that is LOCAL to
# the function/scriptblock where $QueryBuilder was defined (not script-scope,
# not global), that variable resolves to $null here - PowerShell's dynamic
# scoping does not expose a defining function's locals to a different function
# that later invokes the block. This silently produces a malformed query (empty
# report code / fight ID / etc), which typically comes back as zero results with
# NO error, not an exception - exactly the failure mode that caught this the
# first time (every fight's healing/casts events silently returned 0). ALWAYS
# call `.GetNewClosure()` on $QueryBuilder wherever it references anything other
# than genuine script-scope variables, e.g.:
#   $queryBuilder = { param($startTime) "query { ... $localVar ... }" }.GetNewClosure()

# ===== TBC consumable classification (added 2026-07-15) =====
# Real TBC rule (patch 2.1+): a character can have EITHER (1 Battle Elixir +
# 1 Guardian Elixir) OR (1 Flask, which occupies both slots at once) - never
# a flask alongside either elixir type, never two of the same elixir type.
# Fixed a real, live bug found by inspecting already-pulled data: every one of
# this project's 5 pull scripts (pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1 and all four
# pull_top100_*.ps1) used a single `$_.name -match 'Flask|Elixir'` match to
# populate one conflated "flaskActive"/"flaskName" pair - confirmed on real
# data to have mislabeled "Elixir of Draenic Wisdom" (a Guardian Elixir, not
# a flask) as the "flask" on every already-pulled report across all 4
# healers. These lists are static, well-established TBC game content (not
# something to "discover" per-report the way a class's cooldown kit is) -
# kept here, in the one module every pull script already imports, rather
# than duplicated 5 times (same reasoning as the 19-slot gear table in
# ReportRenderLib.psm1). An aura containing "Elixir" that matches neither
# list is real data the pipeline genuinely can't classify (an off-meta or
# unlisted elixir) - Get-ConsumableClassification returns $null for that slot
# rather than guessing which type it is.

# name. This was a real, live bug: it silently classified Danceswtrees as
# never running a Battle Elixir all raid, when she was actually running
# Elixir of Healing Power on every kill - only caught because the player
# herself knew the real loadout and the mismatch didn't match lived
