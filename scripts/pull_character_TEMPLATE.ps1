# pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1
#
# v2 GraphQL pull (migrated from v1 REST 2026-07-12 - see the approved migration
# plan, C:\Users\raymo\.claude\plans\playful-baking-sunset.md, for the full
# rationale). The old v1 script is preserved as pull_character_TEMPLATE_v1.ps1 for
# reference/rollback - this one passed a full equivalence check against a real,
# already-pulled character+report (Danceswtrees, report Fm9XdWYtz8VCLnwg, all 9
# boss kills byte-for-byte matched on every event/consumables/gear/activetime/
# deaths field build_boss_report_data.ps1 actually reads) before taking over the
# production filename.
#
# WHY THIS MIGRATION (short version - see the plan file for the full writeup):
# v1's only percentile sources (/parses/character/, /rankings/character/) return
# either an incomplete "notable parses" list or a single personal-best entry -
# neither can answer "what was this exact report+fight's percentile," which is
# structurally why 8 of 9 kills in a real report came back with null percentile
# even after a fresh re-pull. v2's reportData.report(code).rankings(fightIDs:[...])
# answers that exactly, confirmed live against real data this session.
#
# Every other v1 call this script made also has a confirmed, live-tested v2
# equivalent (see WclV2Api.psm1 and the plan file's mapping table). All output
# FILE SHAPES are preserved exactly as v1 produced them, so build_boss_report_data.ps1
# needs no changes except where it reads percentile from (see step 5 below) -
# confirmed via grep that it only reads $fightsData.fights[].boss/.kill/.start_time/
# .end_time (not the old friendlies/enemies/pets split), so the flat v2 actors[]
# list is a safe, real simplification there, not a compatibility risk.
#
# Auth: v2_client_id.txt / v2_client_secret.txt / v2_access_token.txt at repo
# root (gitignored, same convention as apikey.txt) - see WclV2Api.psm1's header
# for how to register a client if these don't exist yet.
#
# Result: data\Characters\{CharacterName}\{ReportCode}\
#   (folder keyed by ReportCode, not raid date - two raids can happen on the same
#   calendar date, and per-boss-kill files below carry no report code of their
#   own, so a shared date folder would risk one report's data overwriting
#   another's. The resolved raid date is instead persisted as fights_*.json's
#   own "raidDate" field.)
#           fights_{reportCode}.json          <- reshaped to v1's field names (see Step 1), plus "raidDate"
