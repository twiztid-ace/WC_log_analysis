# pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1
#
# Pulls one character's full raid-night data set for the ATNF Healer Analysis pipeline,
# steps 1-4 of WORKFLOW.md, fully automated - no manual JSON inspection or filled-in
# placeholders required.
#
# Given a report code (or full report URL) and a character name, this:
#   1. Fetches (or reuses a cached copy of) the report's fight list
#   2. Reads the raid date straight from the report title
#   3. Looks up the character's class/server/region AND report-local numeric actor ID
#      from the report's own friendlies[] list (no need to already know these - only
#      pass -Server/-Region/-Class to override, e.g. if the character isn't in this
#      particular report for some reason - see the note on that below, since it now
#      limits what Step 4 can do)
#   4. Pulls, per boss kill (boss != 0 && kill == true):
#        - healing events   (COMPLETE per-spell + per-target healing breakdown, via
#                             /report/events/healing/ with sourceid= - see below for why
#                             this replaced the healing TABLE)
#        - casts events     (COMPLETE cooldown/utility/consumable casts, each with a
#                             real target, via /report/events/casts/ with sourceid= -
#                             replaced the casts TABLE for the same reason)
#        - consumables       (flask/food active-at-pull-start + real Tree of Life uptime
#                              %, replaces the buffs table - see "Buff uptime redesign"
#                              below for why the table version was actually wrong, not
#                              just unverified)
#        - deaths table     (fight-wide raid death list, not class-scoped - unchanged)
#   5. Pulls the character's full parse history (for real per-fight WCL percentiles)
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY THIS PULLS EVENTS INSTEAD OF TABLES FOR HEALING/CASTS (2026-07-11 redesign)
# ============================================================================
# The /report/tables/{healing,casts}/{code} views silently cap their per-player
# "abilities" array at 5 entries - confirmed by cross-checking against real
# /report/events data during a live debugging session. The table's entry-level
# `total` stays accurate; only the per-spell breakdown gets truncated, with NO
# error and NO visible signal. This was caught two ways on the same real report:
#   - Danceswtrees's Leotheras kill: healing table said total=176374 but the 5
#     listed abilities only summed to 166830 (9544 missing). The equivalent
#     /report/events/healing/ pull (sourceid-scoped) summed to exactly 176374 -
#     a perfect match, confirming events are complete and the table wasn't.
#   - Turkeykin's Hydross kill: the casts table showed 5 abilities (Starfire,
#     Moonfire, Faerie Fire, Force of Nature, Spell Power) with NO Innervate,
#     despite Innervate definitely being cast that fight (confirmed via a
#     targeted /report/events pull with a real target: Turkeykin -> Churbert).
# This affects EVERY previously-pulled healing/casts table file - both spell
# composition and cooldown/utility counts built on those files should be treated
# as unverified until re-pulled with this script.
#
# The correct endpoint is /report/events/{view}/{code} with `sourceid` as a real,
# documented, standalone query parameter (confirmed against the actual v1 swagger
# spec - NOT `source.id`, `sourceID`, or a bare `source=` param, all of which were
# tried first and silently ignored rather than erroring, which cost real time to
# track down). There is no documented pagination/limit override for this endpoint;
# a real 3983-event unfiltered pull for one fight came back complete (last event
# landed within 90ms of the fight's actual end), which is reassuring but not a
# guarantee for busier/longer fights - this script logs the event count returned
# for every pull so unusually round or suspiciously large counts are visible in
# the console output rather than silently trusted.
#
# CONSEQUENCE FOR CHARACTERS NOT IN THIS REPORT'S friendlies[]: sourceid is a
# report-local numeric actor ID, only resolvable from friendlies[]. If -Class/
# -Server/-Region overrides are used because the character genuinely isn't in
# this report, Step 4 (fight-level pulls) is skipped entirely - there is no
# sourceid to scope the events calls to, and if the character wasn't in this
# report they have no events in it anyway. Step 5 (parse history) still runs
# since it only needs name/server/region, not a report-local ID.
#
# NOT a separate pull, and doesn't need to be: resources / resources-gains
# (mana-over-time, HPM) as an API endpoint is confirmed dead (tested for real
# 2026-07-12, every `abilityid` variant, see WORKFLOW.md gotcha #11) - but every
# casts event this script already saves carries a `classResources[0]` object with
# real mana data under misleadingly-generic field names (`amount`=max mana pool,
# `max`=that spell's real mana cost, `type`=current mana at that moment - verified
# against a full real kill's cast sequence). HPM is already computable from
# `*_casts_events.json`, no new pull needed here.
#
# Run this from your repo ROOT directory, which should contain:
#   - an apikey.txt file at the root, with just your WCL API key on a single line
#     (add apikey.txt to your .gitignore so it never gets committed)
#   - a data\Characters\ folder (created automatically if it doesn't exist yet)

# ===== Buff uptime redesign (2026-07-11) =====
# The old `/report/tables/buffs/{code}?sourceclass=X&hostility=0` call was found to
# merge every player of that class in the fight into one flat list - not scoped to
# this character at all (confirmed on real data: a single file showed Moonkin Form +
# Dire Bear Form + Tree of Life simultaneously, three different specs' forms,
# impossible for one character). Replaced with two independently-validated pieces:
#
# 1. FLASK/ELIXIR + FOOD: these last ~1-2 hours, far longer than any single fight, so
#    "was it active when this pull started" is a reliable stand-in for "active the
#    whole fight." Pulled from the `combatantinfo` snapshot event (the one confirmed-
#    working flat, no-`{view}`-segment form of /report/events/) - its `auras` list
#    includes whatever buffs were already active at that moment, which covers
#    consumables drunk/eaten before the pull even started (something no apply/remove
#    event reconstruction could ever see, since the log has no record of anything
#    before it starts recording).
#
# 2. TREE OF LIFE: unlike flask/food, this visibly toggles mid-raid (confirmed on
#    real data: Danceswtrees dropped out of it during a kill to combo Nature's
#    Swiftness + Healing Touch), so a pull-start snapshot isn't enough - this one
#    needs real interval reconstruction from apply/remove events, pulled ONCE per
#    report (not per fight - cheaper, and the events naturally span fight boundaries
#    anyway) via /report/events/buffs/ with sourceid=, then intersected with each
#    fight's own time window. Two real findings shaped this:
#    - Tree of Life logs under TWO guids (33891, 34123) that always show 33891
#      paired with 34123, but 34123 ALSO fires constantly on its own in patterns that
#      don't match manual form-toggling (rapid apply/remove/refresh cycles within a
#      single fight). Only 33891 is used - empirically the trustworthy signal,
#      34123's exact meaning is unverified and it's excluded rather than guessed at.
#    - Real data has orphan `removebuff` events (no matching prior `applybuff`) more
#      than once in a report, not just at the very start. Only the FIRST event in the
#      whole report can be safely read as "was already active since report start" -
#      treating every later orphan the same way produced an impossible >100% uptime
#      when first tested. Later orphans are treated as a no-op instead.
