# summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1
#
# Reads the raw Top 100 data pulled by pull_top100_druid.ps1 and computes the derived
# benchmark stats our analysis actually uses - PER BOSS:
#   - HPS / overheal percentiles           (from rankings.json + *_healing_events.json)
#   - Top 100 spell composition            (from *_healing_events.json, grouped by guid)
#   - Top 100 target concentration         (from *_healing_events.json, grouped by target)
#   - Top 100 cooldown/utility/consumable cast counts, with self-vs-other target split
#                                           (from *_casts_events.json)
#   - Top 100 self-buff stats: % with flask/food active at pull start, average real
#     Tree of Life uptime %                (from *_consumables.json)
#
# Outputs compact CSVs, small enough to upload to Claude Project knowledge:
#   benchmark_summary.csv               <- one row per boss (HPS, overheal, target stats)
#   benchmark_spell_composition.csv     <- one row per boss+spell (Top 100 avg % of healing)
#   benchmark_cooldowns.csv             <- one row per boss+ability (Top 100 avg casts, self%)
#   benchmark_buffs.csv                 <- one row per boss (Top 100 flask/food/Tree of Life)
#
# ============================================================================
# 2026-07-12: SWITCHED FROM TOP-10-AVG TO TOP-100-AVG (SAME DAY AS THE ACTIVE/ARCHIVED
# REWRITE BELOW, LATER PASS)
# ============================================================================
# Every aggregate here (spell composition, target coverage, cooldown/utility casts,
# flask/food/Tree of Life) used to be computed over only the best 10 of however many
# parses were actually pulled (usually ~100), discarding the other ~90 real, already-
# fetched data points. Since we already pay the API cost to pull the full Top 100, and
# a 100-person sample is a meaningfully less noisy average than 10, every "Top10*"
# column below is now a "Top100*" column computed over the FULL real sample for that
# boss (however many parses actually parsed successfully - usually close to 100, never
# assumed to be exactly 100, see SampleSize/SampleUsed on every row). HPS_Top1 (the
# single best parse) and HPS_Median (median of the full sample) were already
# whole-sample stats and are unchanged by this - only the "-Avg" style aggregates moved
# off the top-10-only slice.
# ============================================================================
#
# ============================================================================
# 2026-07-12: FIXED - SELF-ONLY SPELLS WERE MISCOUNTED AS "NOT SELF"
# ============================================================================
# Found while switching to Top100-avg (above) surfaced Nature's Swiftness at 0% self
# across a full 100-person sample on Hydross - implausible, since NS can only ever be
# cast on the caster. Root cause: WCL logs a self-only-castable spell's cast event with
# `target: {"name":"Environment","id":-1,...}` instead of a real actor, since there's
# no real other-actor target to report - the pull scripts' target-name annotation
# leaves `targetName` as `null` in this case (no targetID to resolve), and the old
# self-check (`sourceName -eq targetName`) treated that null as "not self" instead of
# recognizing it as "no real target exists, so it can only have been self." Fixed by
# also counting a null/empty targetName as self - a spell logged with no real
# other-actor target mechanically cannot have gone to anyone else. Only affects the
# self%/SelfCount aggregate in this script; the pull scripts' own target-name
# annotation was also fixed the same day so future pulls store a real name instead of
# null for these events (see their own header notes) - this script's fix handles both
# old (null) and new (self-name) data correctly either way, so no re-pull or bulk
# re-processing of already-pulled files was needed.
# ============================================================================
#
# ============================================================================
# 2026-07-12: ACTIVE/ARCHIVED + MANIFEST AWARE, DUAL-MODE
# ============================================================================
# pull_top100_druid.ps1 no longer writes into a fresh data\Classes\{Class}\{date}\ folder
# every run - it maintains one persistent data\Classes\{Class}\active\ folder (only
# currently-in-the-Top-100 parses) plus data\Classes\{Class}\archived\ (parses that have
# dropped out, kept forever) and a manifest.json tracking per-boss pull dates and
# per-parse status. Paladin/Priest/Shaman are NOT on this model yet - they're still
# both v1 (healing TABLE, not events) AND the old date-stamped-folder convention, pulled
# by pull_top100_paladin.ps1/pull_top100_priest_holy.ps1/pull_top100_shaman.ps1.
#
# This script supports BOTH conventions, chosen by whether -DateFolder is passed:
#   - -DateFolder omitted -> active/archived model: reads/writes
#     data\Classes\{Class}\active\, tracks benchmarkGeneratedDate in manifest.json,
#     archives the previous CSV set to archived\benchmark_history\{date}\ on a real
#     day-over-day regen. This is the only mode Druid supports (it has no date folder
#     to point at anymore - migrate_class_to_active.ps1 already converted it).
#   - -DateFolder {date} passed -> old mode, unchanged from before this rewrite: reads/
#     writes data\Classes\{Class}\{date}\ directly, no manifest, no staleness tracking,
#     no CSV history. This is what Paladin/Priest/Shaman still need until they're
#     ported to the active/archived model (see WORKFLOW.md gotcha #25).
#
# STALENESS: manifest.json's top-level `benchmarkGeneratedDate` is a plain "yyyy-MM-dd"
# string, never a boolean flag (a stored true/false would silently go wrong the instant
# the date rolls over - see pull_top100_druid.ps1's header for the same reasoning applied
# to lastPulledDate/rankingsSnapshotDate). Staleness is always computed fresh by comparing
# to today's date: generated today = fresh, generated any earlier day = stale. This script
# prints that comparison at the start for visibility, but ALWAYS regenerates all four CSVs
# regardless - recomputation is local/free (no API calls), so there's no reason to skip
# it, only a reason to tell the person whether the numbers they're about to get were
# already fresh or not.
#
# CSV HISTORY: previously, re-running this script silently overwrote the four CSVs with
# no history kept. Now, before writing, if active\benchmark_summary.csv already exists
# AND manifest.benchmarkGeneratedDate is an earlier date than today (i.e. this is a real
# new day's regeneration, not a same-day re-run), the existing four CSVs are copied to
# archived\benchmark_history\{that old date}\ before being overwritten - one folder per
# calendar day the numbers actually changed, no duplicate entries for same-day re-runs.
#
# ============================================================================
# ORIGINAL 2026-07-11 REWRITE NOTES (still accurate, unrelated to the above): reads
# events, not tables, for healing/casts. Two real bugs fixed in the process, both
# confirmed against actual pulled data before this rewrite:
# ============================================================================
# 1. TRUNCATION: the old healing/casts TABLE views silently capped their per-player
#    "abilities" array at 5 entries (see WORKFLOW.md gotcha list). This script now reads
#    *_healing_events.json / *_casts_events.json instead - complete, per-event records,
#    no cap. Spell composition and cooldown counts from any run of the old script should
#    be treated as unverified.
# 2. LOCALIZATION SPLIT: the old script grouped spell composition by ability NAME. Real
#    data check on this exact Hydross/Lurker pull found Lifebloom alone logged under 7
#    different localized names (Korean/Portuguese/German/French/Chinese/Spanish/English)
#    across the Top 100 sample - the old script would have silently split one spell into
#    seven separate rows instead of aggregating them. This script groups by ability GUID
#    instead (guid is locale-independent), and picks a display name preferring ASCII
#    when multiple names are seen for the same guid (mirrors the existing player-name
#    convention from gotcha #2 in the pull scripts).
# 3. DIFFERENT GUIDS SHARING A NAME ARE NOT MERGED. An earlier version of this rewrite
#    tried a second pass merging by the resolved display name (to combine what looked
#    like duplicate "Lifebloom" rows from different guids) - real data proved that wrong.
#    Lifebloom's two guids (33763, 33778) both display as "Lifebloom" in every language,
#    but are empirically different: 33763 is 100% tick=true, ~310 avg amount (the HoT
#    component); 33778 is 100% tick=false, ~515 avg amount (the "bloom" burst heal on
#    expiry) - two real mechanics, not a duplicate. Regrowth/Rejuvenation's dual guids
#    looked different again on inspection (mixed tick/non-tick, similar amounts, very
#    different frequency - more consistent with rank variance). Rather than assert what
#    each guid "means" per spell (which only covers spells someone has actually checked
#    and risks being wrong), every guid stays its own row always; when two guids share a
#    display name the guid is appended to disambiguate instead of guessing at a label.
# 4. BUFF UPTIME, ADDED BACK LATER THE SAME DAY. The original *_buffs.json (a table
#    view, sourceclass=Druid&hostility=0, no `by=` param) was found to merge every
#    Druid's buffs in a fight into one flat list, not scoped to the ranked player the
#    file was named after - confirmed on real data showing Moonkin Form + Dire Bear
#    Form + Tree of Life simultaneously (three different specs' forms, impossible for
#    one character). benchmark_buffs.csv was dropped entirely for a while as a result.
#    It's back now, reading *_consumables.json instead: flask/food are booleans (active
#    at the pull-start combatantinfo snapshot, since those buffs outlast any single
#    fight and a snapshot is enough), Tree of Life is a real reconstructed uptime %
#    (apply/remove event interval reconstruction, guid 33891 only - its paired guid
#    34123 shares the display name but toggles far more often in ways that don't match
#    manual form-toggling, empirically untrustworthy, excluded). See
#    pull_top100_druid.ps1's header for the full validation writeup.
#
# Target coverage/top1% are also now computed from the complete per-event target
# breakdown instead of the healing table's `targets[]` array, which had the exact same
# undocumented top-5 truncation as `abilities[]` - "coverage" still means "top 5
# recipients as % of total", same definition the templates already use, just accurate.
