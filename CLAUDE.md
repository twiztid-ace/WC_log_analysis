# ATNF Healer Analysis — Claude Code orientation

This is a WoW Classic (TBC/SSC-TK era) raid healer analysis pipeline: pull real combat
log data from Warcraft Logs, benchmark it against Top 100 parses, and generate
a static HTML site auditing each healer's performance per boss kill. All four Fresh
SSC/TK healer classes' pipelines (`pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1` — shared/class-agnostic —,
`pull_top100_druid.ps1`, `pull_top100_shaman.ps1`, `pull_top100_priest_holy.ps1`,
`pull_top100_paladin.ps1`) now pull that data via WCL's **v2 GraphQL API** (Druid
migrated 2026-07-12, Shaman ported the same day as its own "Phase 3" pilot, Priest
ported 2026-07-13, Paladin ported the same day right after Priest — see WORKFLOW.md's
"v2 GraphQL API" section). No class remains on the original v1 REST API.

**Read `WORKFLOW.md` first, in full, before touching anything.** It is the single
source of truth for this project — API endpoints, file formats, known bugs, and 33
numbered "gotchas" documenting real mistakes already made and fixed. Assume anything
not in WORKFLOW.md is unverified. This file is just a map to get you oriented quickly;
WORKFLOW.md has the actual depth. **`README.md`** (repo root) is the practical
day-to-day companion to this file — setup steps and the exact command sequence for
running the pipeline, including entirely without Claude (see "Local-scripting
pipeline" below); read it when you actually need to run something, not just to
get oriented.

## You can do something I (this conversation's Claude) couldn't

This whole project was built through a text-based chat where I could never execute
PowerShell myself — every script had to be handed to the person to run, with results
pasted back as text before I could react. That was slow and error-prone (see gotcha
#19 in WORKFLOW.md for a bug that only got caught because of exactly this friction).

**You're running in an environment with real command execution.** Actually run the
`.ps1` scripts. Actually inspect the JSON output files directly instead of asking the
person to paste console output. This should make you meaningfully more effective at
catching bugs than I was — use that.

One catch: these scripts are Windows PowerShell 5.1-specific in places (see gotcha
#13 on `-UseBasicParsing`, gotcha #14 on BOM/encoding issues, gotcha #19 on the
`if/else` array-collapse bug). If you're not running on Windows, don't assume they'll
behave identically on PowerShell 7+/pwsh on Linux/Mac — test before trusting.

## Two generations of this pipeline — don't confuse them

This project has a **simple v1** (already shipped, live on 4 healer sites) and an
**enhanced v2** (Druid and Shaman as of 2026-07-12, Priest and Paladin as of
2026-07-13 — every class this project tracks is now on the v2 methodology).
Reading the repo cold, both look like "real output" — they're not at the same
maturity, and mixing them up is the main way to get confused here.

**Naming collision to watch for:** this "v1/v2" is about *methodology* (simple
gear-check vs. events-based enhanced pipeline) — a completely different axis from
the WCL "v1 REST API / v2 GraphQL API" distinction mentioned above. All four
classes are now on methodology-v2 AND API-v2 — the two axes never actually
diverged for any class ported so far (Shaman, Priest, and Paladin all went from
v1/v1 straight to v2/v2 in one pass, same as Druid's own history), so this
project still hasn't seen a *partial* port (e.g. API-only migration without the
events-based rewrite) that would actually split the two axes apart for one
class. Don't assume "v2" means the same thing in every sentence of this file or
WORKFLOW.md without checking which axis it's on.

**A third, independent axis exists now too: *authoring method*** — how the final
HTML for a methodology-v2 report actually gets produced, separate from both axes
above. Added 2026-07-14 (see "Local-scripting pipeline" below): Claude hand-writing
every page's HTML directly (how all 4 existing real v2 sites were built), vs.
`render_healer_report.ps1` mechanically rendering it from JSON + a small
Claude-authored `findings.json` (the new default going forward, see below). A page
being "v2" says nothing about which authoring method produced it — check whether
its raid folder has a `{code}_findings.json`/`{code}_analysis.json` next to its
`report_data.json` (script-rendered) or not (hand-written) if it matters.

- **v1 (simple)**: gear check + basic spell composition + a couple of other checks,
  built on the old `/report/tables/` healing view (5-entry truncation bug and all —
  see WORKFLOW.md gotcha #4/#15). This is what originally produced the 4
  fully-built healer sites, moved to `docs/` on 2026-07-12 (see "Hosting" below —
  they're no longer at the repo root). Treat these as a finished snapshot of the
  *old* methodology, not a template for new output. As of 2026-07-13 every one of
  the 4 healers also has a real v2 site for at least one raid night (see "Current
  state") — the v1 pages remain only as historical reference, moved aside to
  `-v1`/`_v1`-suffixed sibling folders rather than deleted where superseded.
- **v2 (enhanced)**: events-based healing/casts (no truncation), cooldown/utility
  tracking with self-vs-other targets (Druid: Innervate/Nature's Swiftness/
  Swiftmend/Rebirth/Dark Rune, real buff uptime via Tree of Life interval
  reconstruction; Shaman: Earth Shield/Mana Tide Totem/Ancestral Swiftness/Dark
  Rune; Priest: Shadowfiend/Power Word: Shield/Chakra/Blessing of Life/Fear Ward/
  Dark Rune; Paladin: Holy Shock/Divine Favor/Divine Shield/Cleanse/Hand of
  Protection/Blessing of Freedom/Dark Rune — no Rebirth-equivalent or
  self-buff-uptime concept exists for Shaman, Priest, OR Paladin in this TBC
  ruleset, confirmed against real data for all three, not assumed), Top 100
  benchmarking, CSV summarization. **Resto Druid, Resto Shaman, Holy Priest, and
  Holy Paladin** all have this now (see "Current state" below). All four full v2
  healer sites have been generated end-to-end (Danceswtrees/Druid,
  Vajomee/Shaman, Lippies/Priest, and Crowns/Paladin as of 2026-07-13) — every
  healer this project tracks now has a real v2 site (see "Current state").
  `examples/` has one older reference page but it's out of date (see below).

## Data model — active/archived + manifest.json (all four classes now)

Replaced the old "fresh date-stamped folder every pull" convention for Druid on
2026-07-12, because that convention re-fetched all ~1,000 Top 100 parses from the
WCL API on every single run even though the vast majority don't change between
runs and a completed log's data can never change once pulled. Shaman was built
directly on this model from day one when it was ported the same day, Priest the
same way again on 2026-07-13, and Paladin the same way again right after Priest
(no old date-folder data existed worth migrating forward for any of the three —
see WORKFLOW.md's "v2 GraphQL API" section for why). Full design rationale,
manifest schema, and the exact diff algorithm are in WORKFLOW.md's
"Active/archived data model" section — read that before touching any pull
script. The short version:
- `data\Classes\{Druid,Shaman,Priest,Paladin}\manifest.json` tracks per-boss
  `lastPulledDate`/`rankingsSnapshotDate` and per-parse `active`/`archived` status.
- `active\` holds only what's currently in a boss's Top 100. `archived\` holds
  everything that's ever dropped out, kept forever, never deleted.
- Staleness is always a plain `yyyy-MM-dd` date compared to today at read time —
  never a stored boolean (see WORKFLOW.md for why that matters).
- **No class remains on the old date-folder convention as of Paladin's port.**
  The old convention is documented in WORKFLOW.md purely as reference for a
  hypothetical future new class.

## `data\Characters\` and `docs\` folders — report code, not raid date (2026-07-14)

Separate from the `data\Classes\` model above: every per-character raid-night
folder (`data\Characters\{Name}\{X}\` and `docs\{healer}\{X}\`) is now keyed by
**WCL report code**, not raid date — e.g. `data\Characters\Crowns\XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb\`,
`docs\crowns\XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb\`. This replaced a real, confirmed bug: the old
`{yyyy-MM-dd}` folder keying meant two different raids pulled for the same
character on the same calendar date (a real, expected scenario — an afternoon
SSC clear and a separate night TK clear, say) would land in the *same* folder,
and the per-boss-kill files inside (`fight14_lurker_healing_events.json`, etc.)
carry no report code of their own — so the second pull would silently overwrite
or corrupt the first's files. The report date is still tracked and shown on every
page — just not as the folder name anymore. It lives as `report_data.json`'s own
`RaidDate` field (and `fights_{code}.json`'s `raidDate` field one level below
that) instead.

**Existing v1-preserved sibling folders are now `{code}-v1`, not `{date}-v1`.**
Several healers have an old v1-methodology site sitting alongside their v2 site
for the same raid night (see "Two generations" above) — e.g.
`docs\crowns\XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb-v1\` next to `docs\crowns\XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb\`, both
built from the exact same real report. `render_healer_report.ps1` refuses to
write into any output folder whose name ends in `-v1`, regardless of what
precedes the suffix.

**All 4 healers' existing real folders were renamed to this convention on
2026-07-14** (both `data\Characters\` and `docs\`, via `git mv` to preserve
history) — this was a one-time migration of already-published data, not just a
go-forward convention change, so **GitHub Pages URLs for every existing raid
night changed** (e.g. `docs/crowns/2026-07-07/` → `docs/crowns/XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb/`)
— any external bookmark/link to an old date-based URL now 404s. Every healer's
hub page (`docs\{healer}\index.html`) raid-row link was updated to match; a
genuinely pre-existing broken link was also found and fixed in the process
(Lippies' raid overview referenced a `_v1` (underscore) folder that never
existed — the real folder was always `-v1` (hyphen); now points at the correct,
renamed `XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb-v1`).

**A healer's raid-list must always read newest-first, and can no longer rely on
insertion order to guarantee that** (fixed the same day) — since folders are
report-code-keyed, the order raids get *generated* in no longer has any natural
relationship to the order they actually happened in (backfilling an older raid
after a newer one is real, not hypothetical). `update_hub_pages.ps1` now always
re-parses every existing row's own date text and rewrites the whole list stably
sorted by date descending on every insert, rather than just prepending — see
that script's own header comment, and its `-ResortOnly` mode (re-sorts an
existing healer's list without inserting anything, e.g. after a manual edit).

## Local-scripting pipeline (2026-07-14) — replaces Claude hand-writing HTML

Generating a report used to mean Claude hand-writing ~550 lines of HTML per
boss page, 11 times per report (10 boss pages + 1 raid overview), re-emitting
near-identical CSS/structure every time — this is how all 4 existing real v2
sites (Danceswtrees, Vajomee, Lippies, Crowns) were actually built, and it burns
a lot of tokens for output that's almost entirely mechanical. Built to fix that:
a 3-stage pipeline where a script computes every real number and pre-flags
every script-safe judgment call, Claude authors only the handful of genuinely
interpretive sentences, and a second script deterministically renders the final
HTML. **No existing site was regenerated through this new pipeline** — the
decision when this was built was to leave the 4 existing hand-written sites
untouched and apply the new pipeline to future report generations only.

- `scripts\build_boss_analysis.ps1` — reads `{code}_report_data.json`, writes
  `{code}_analysis.json` next to it: per-boss deviation flags vs. the Top 100
  benchmark, cooldown over/undercast flags, self-death detection,
  nearest-cooldown-to-death lookups, gear enchant gaps, canned-caveat tags
  (Priest PWS benchmark bias, Paladin Holy Shock guid split — see "Current
  state" below), and (added 2026-07-15) `SpellRanks` — mechanical, no-LLM
  detection of a spell name with 2+ distinct real guids in play this kill
  (character and/or Top 100), reusing `SpellGaps`' own union-matching. **WCL's
  v2 API has no "rank" field anywhere** (confirmed live via `__schema`
  introspection on `GameAbility`/`ReportAbility` — both only have
  id/icon/name/type) and `gameData.abilities` is a flat, unfiltered, 456,806-row
  pagination with no name/class filter, so pulling "all abilities" isn't a
  viable way to get rank data either. Real per-cast mana cost (this kill's own
  `classResources` data, captured per-guid in `build_boss_report_data.ps1` as
  `ManaCostByGuid`) is the only available signal for which rank is "higher" —
  known only for guids the character actually cast this kill, `null`
  (rendered `?`, never guessed) otherwise. Rendered as a new, always-mechanical
  "Spell ranks in play" block in section 02 of every boss template, wrapped in
  `<!--@OPTIONAL:SPELL_RANKS_SECTION-->` — a boss where no spell has 2+ ranks
  gets the whole block removed, not shown empty. Verified against Vajomee's
  real Vashj kill (Chain Heal: 5 real guids, 260-540 mana; Lesser Healing Wave:
  3 real guids) matching the exact numbers already found by hand earlier this
  session. Zero API calls, zero LLM involvement for any of this.
- `{code}_findings.json` — the ONE file an LLM authors: ~4 free-text
  coverage-note strings per boss (`SCORECARD_FINDING`/`SPELL_COMPOSITION_FINDING`/
  `COOLDOWN_FINDING`/`TARGET_FINDING`) plus a `RaidOverview` object, following the
  schema documented in `render_healer_report.ps1`'s own header comment and in
  the `generate-healer-report` skill.
- `scripts\render_healer_report.ps1` — merges `report_data.json` +
  `{code}_analysis.json` + `{code}_findings.json` + the class's boss template +
  `raid_overview_template.html` into the final HTML pages. Zero LLM involvement;
  refuses to run with an incomplete `findings.json` or write into a `-v1`-suffixed
  output folder.
- `scripts\update_hub_pages.ps1` — surgical upsert of the two hub pages (see
  above for its date-sorting behavior). Zero LLM involvement.
- `scripts\build_placeholder_findings.ps1` — stands in for the Claude-authoring
  step with an obvious `[CLAUDE PLACEHOLDER ...]` string in every required
  field, so the pipeline can be proven/run start-to-finish with no LLM at all
  (see README.md's "Running the pipeline manually, without Claude"). Output from
  this is never meant to be published as-is.
- `scripts\lib\ReportRenderLib.psm1` — shared helpers both scripts above import:
  CSV-string-to-number parsing, the 19-slot gear-order/enchantable-slot tables
  (gotcha #31's exact bug class — kept in exactly one place on purpose),
  per-class cooldown target-labeling mode (self/party/other), and the
  `@LOOP`/`@SLOT`/`@OPTIONAL` HTML-comment templating primitives the 7 template
  files use (string/regex based, no DOM library, consistent with every other
  script here).
- **Regression-tested against all 4 classes now** (2026-07-14: Crowns/Paladin
  and Vajomee/Shaman first, Danceswtrees/Druid and Lippies/Priest added the same
  day) — all mechanical content matched the real hand-written pages exactly
  (after accounting for a few deliberate, documented canonicalizations: sort
  order, `0%` vs `0.0%`, guid-suffix-only-on-name-collision, and — Lippies
  specifically — a gear-consistency banner whose real prose structure the
  template's fixed wrapper text can't reproduce verbatim). The Druid fixture
  exercised both Druid-only paths for real: Tree of Life uptime (0% on 7 of 9
  kills, real non-zero values of 93.7%/100% on the other 2 — all matched
  exactly) and the conditional Rebirth row (5 of 9 kills had a real,
  judgment-worthy death-to-Rebirth case; `IncludeRebirthRow` correctly
  included/omitted the row on every boss). The Priest fixture confirmed the
  `priest_pws_benchmark_bias` canned caveat renders correctly.
  The regression pass also caught real mistakes *in the original hand-written
  pages* that the new pipeline avoids — not just non-regressive, a real
  accuracy improvement each time: a mislabeled Divine Favor self% on 2 of 10
  Crowns pages, a missed OffHand missing-enchant flag on Vajomee's gear audit,
  and on Danceswtrees specifically, 2 of 3 real missing-enchant gaps (Feet,
  OffHand) that the hand-written raid overview never flagged at all (only
  caught the cloak).
- **Real bug found and fixed during the Druid/Priest regression pass**: Mana
  Potion's cooldown-table "target" column always rendered as `—` instead of
  `self`, even when it was genuinely cast, for **every class** — root cause was
  `build_boss_report_data.ps1` hardcoding Mana Potion's `Targets` array to `@()`
  regardless of real casts, which silently broke `Format-CooldownTarget`'s
  "self" mode (it checks `Targets.Count`, not the `Count` field directly).
  Fixed to populate one real `Target = "self"` entry per actual cast. **Every
  already-generated `report_data.json` in the repo was regenerated** to
  propagate the fix (all 7 real character+report folders) — this was safe and
  necessary since `build_boss_report_data.ps1` makes zero API calls and is
  meant to be safely re-run at any time, but be aware if a diff shows unrelated
  `report_data.json` churn from 2026-07-14, this is why.
- Two real PowerShell 5.1 source-encoding bugs were hit and fixed while
  building this (see "Ground rules" below for the durable rule) — worth naming
  here since they cost real debugging time twice: a literal non-ASCII character
  embedded directly in a `.ps1` file (once in `ReportRenderLib.psm1`, once
  months apart in `update_hub_pages.ps1`'s date-parsing regex) silently
  mangled into garbage on parse/execution because the file has no BOM.

## Current state — what's solid vs. what's open

**v1 (simple) — shipped, and superseded per class as v2 lands:**
- 4 healer sites' worth of v1 pages still exist (`crowns/`, `danceswtrees/`,
  `lippies/`, `vajomee/` under `docs/`), each with all 10 SSC/TK boss kills for
  one raid night. This is the old gear-check + basic-spell-composition
  methodology — not being extended further, kept only as historical reference
  now that all four classes have a v2 pipeline. Danceswtrees's, Lippies's, and
  Crowns's own v1 pages have already been superseded by real v2 pages for the
  same raid night (moved aside to a `-v1`-suffixed sibling folder, not
  deleted — Crowns's move happened 2026-07-13; folders were still date-named at
  that point, renamed to report-code-named on 2026-07-14, see above — a stray
  `_v1` (underscore) reference in one old cross-link was a genuine pre-existing
  typo, not a second real naming convention, fixed during that rename). Vajomee's
  earliest raid night (2026-07-03, report `Mfz4kW6JpjFPArat`) still has only a
  v1 page, but that's a genuinely separate raid night from her v2 raid nights
  (2026-07-10/`Z4zNt28raQ6GLbkC`, 2026-07-12/`QTaWq74txvPF82AR`), not the same
  night pending a regen — don't assume "class is v2" means every historical
  raid night for that healer has been regenerated.
- `data\Classes\{Shaman,Priest,Paladin}\2026-07-10\` (or 2026-07-07, check the
  actual folder) still exist as the old v1-generation Top 100 pulls, preserved
  untouched on disk, same convention as keeping `*_v1.ps1` scripts around — none
  of these are the active data for their class anymore, superseded by the v2
  ports below.

**v2 (enhanced) — Druid, Shaman, Priest, and Paladin — all four classes now:**
- `pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1` (shared/class-agnostic) and `pull_top100_druid.ps1`
  were migrated from the v1 REST API to the v2 GraphQL API on 2026-07-12 (this was
  originally just meant to fix a null-percentile bug — v1's percentile endpoints
  are structurally incapable of returning an exact report+fight match — but the
  fix was expanded to a full API migration once the root cause was understood).
  `pull_top100_shaman.ps1` was ported the same day, as the "Phase 3" pilot class
  for extending this same v2 architecture beyond Druid; `pull_top100_priest_holy.ps1`
  followed the next day (2026-07-13); `pull_top100_paladin.ps1` followed the same
  day right after Priest — all three modeled directly on `pull_top100_druid.ps1`
  since none of the old v1 scripts shared much structurally with it (sequential,
  single healing-TABLE-per-parse, no casts/consumables/activetime/deaths at
  all). All five scripts were equivalence/smoke tested against real data before
  the old v1-API versions were preserved as `*_v1.ps1` and the new versions
  promoted to the production filenames. Full mapping/rationale for all four
  ported classes in WORKFLOW.md's "v2 GraphQL API" section (the durable copy —
  plan files are session-scoped working documents, and the plan file at
  `C:\Users\raymo\.claude\plans\playful-baking-sunset.md` holds only the Shaman
  port's own plan; neither the Priest nor the Paladin port had a separate plan
  file). **No class uses the v1 REST API or `apikey.txt` anymore.**
- Pipeline validated end to end on real data for all four classes: events-based
  healing/casts (no truncation), cooldown/utility tracking with self-vs-other
  targets (Druid: Innervate/Nature's Swiftness/Swiftmend/Rebirth/Dark Rune with
  real Tree of Life buff uptime; Shaman: Earth Shield/Mana Tide Totem/Ancestral
  Swiftness/Dark Rune, confirmed against a real Vajomee report; Priest:
  Shadowfiend/Power Word: Shield/Chakra/Blessing of Life/Fear Ward/Dark Rune,
  confirmed against a real Lippies report; Paladin: Holy Shock/Divine Favor/
  Divine Shield/Cleanse/Hand of Protection/Blessing of Freedom/Dark Rune,
  confirmed against a real Crowns report — no Rebirth-equivalent or
  self-buff-uptime concept exists for Shaman, Priest, OR Paladin in this TBC
  ruleset), each class's own boss page template.
- All **10 of 10 bosses** pulled and confirmed on disk for Druid
  (`data\Classes\Druid\active\`, 1,000 parses), Shaman
  (`data\Classes\Shaman\active\`, ~995/1,000 — a handful of parses hit the known
  ~0.5% combatantinfo-snapshot gap, see item 3 below), Priest
  (`data\Classes\Priest\active\`, 989/1,000 — 11 failed, same gap, ~1.1%), and
  Paladin (`data\Classes\Paladin\active\`, **989/1,000** — 11 failed, same gap,
  ~1.1%, matching Priest's rate almost exactly). All four use the same
  RunspacePool + active/archived + `manifest.json` model — see "Data model"
  below. **Verify boss/parse counts against `manifest.json` or the actual folder
  before trusting a number someone recalls from memory** — this has drifted from
  reality before.
- `summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1` has been run against all four classes' full
  active sets — all four `benchmark_*.csv` files exist for each in their own
  `data\Classes\{Class}\active\`. Its cooldown-guid table and Tree-of-Life buff
  column were made class-keyed while porting Shaman and extended again for
  Priest and then Paladin (previously a single flat, ungated Druid-only table
  that would have silently miscomputed cooldown numbers for any other class —
  see WORKFLOW.md gotcha #29/#30 area).
- **Real finding from the Priest benchmark run**: Power Word: Shield's
  `Top100UsedPct` in `benchmark_cooldowns.csv` is ~0% on 9 of 10 bosses (1% on
  Kael'thas) — verified not a bug despite Lippies herself casting it 8 times in
  her own raid night; the benchmark population is systematically biased away
  from this ability by the HPS ranking metric, not reflecting a real "norm." Any
  Priest boss page must not read a real character's Shield usage as "overusing"
  it relative to this benchmark.
- **Real finding from the Paladin benchmark run, corrected after checking the
  full Top 100 sample**: Holy Shock's cast (guid 33072) and its resulting heal
  are logged under two DIFFERENT real guids, not one — the heal lands under
  guid 33074, also named "Holy Shock." The first draft of this finding (scoped
  only to Crowns's own report) claimed Holy Shock "doesn't itself heal," which
  turned out to be too broad — the wider Top 100 sample shows real players
  landing real Holy Shock heals (guid 33074) worth 0.6-1.7% of total healing on
  several bosses; Crowns's own 8 real casts this raid simply never happened to
  land one. Corrected in `pull_top100_paladin.ps1`'s header,
  `build_boss_report_data.ps1`'s and `summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1`'s
  comments, and `boss_page_template_paladin.html`'s guidance before this ever
  reached a real generated page — see WORKFLOW.md's "v2 GraphQL API" section
  for the full writeup and the lesson it draws (a discovery pass scoped to one
  character's report needs checking against the full Top 100 sample before a
  "never does X" claim goes into permanent documentation).
- **All four full v2 healer sites have been generated end-to-end**: Danceswtrees/
  Druid (`docs\danceswtrees\Fm9XdWYtz8VCLnwg\`), Vajomee/Shaman
  (`docs\vajomee\Z4zNt28raQ6GLbkC\`), Lippies/Priest (`docs\lippies\XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb\`),
  and Crowns/Paladin (`docs\crowns\XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb\`, generated 2026-07-13) —
  each a real raid overview + one page per boss kill, hand-written by Claude
  from real `build_boss_report_data.ps1` output (not templated filler, and not
  produced by the newer `render_healer_report.ps1` pipeline — see "Local-scripting
  pipeline" above). Crowns's v1 pages for the same raid night were moved aside
  to `docs\crowns\XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb-v1\` (not deleted) once the v2 pages were
  confirmed. **All folder names above reflect the 2026-07-14 report-code rename
  — these were `docs\{healer}\{date}\` right up until that migration** (see
  "data\Characters\ and docs\ folders" above). There is no more open per-healer
  v2 site regen work on the original four-healer scope.

**Recently closed:**
- Crowns's v2 site regen (2026-07-13) — done. Has a full raid overview + all 10
  boss pages, committed (`e463b9f6`, `a1633da6`) and pushed to `master`. Every
  one of the 4 existing healer sites now has a real v2 version.
- The GitHub Pages toggle (2026-07-13) — done. Confirmed live by fetching
  `https://twiztid-ace.github.io/WC_log_analysis/` directly: it serves the real
  site homepage listing all 4 healers (Crowns, Danceswtrees, Lippies, Vajomee).
  See the "Hosting" section below.
- The local-scripting pipeline (2026-07-14) — built, and regression-tested
  against all 4 classes (see "Local-scripting pipeline" above). Caught a real,
  now-fixed bug affecting every class along the way (Mana Potion's cooldown
  target always showing `—` instead of `self`). Not yet used to generate any
  brand-new real report (only re-verified against existing real data).
- `data\Characters\`/`docs\` folders renamed from date to report code
  (2026-07-14), including the 4 healers' existing real data — see
  "data\Characters\ and docs\ folders" above. **Any doc-audit or link check
  should use the report-code paths in this file, not the `{date}\` paths an
  older version of this file (or memory of one) might suggest.**
- **An earlier raid tier — Gruul's Lair (High King Maulgar, Gruul the
  Dragonkiller) and Magtheridon's Lair — was added to the pipeline
  (2026-07-15)**, alongside the existing SSC/TK tier, for all four classes:
  `pull_top100_{druid,shaman,priest_holy,paladin}.ps1`,
  `pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1`, `build_boss_report_data.ps1`, and
  `summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1` all know about the new boss IDs now, and a
  real Top 100 benchmark pull completed for all four classes' `active\Gruul\`
  and `active\Magtheridon\` folders (~500 real parses each, confirmed on disk
  for Druid, Shaman, Priest, and Paladin alike). This is genuinely older
  content than SSC/TK, not a new raid tier being
  added on top — the point was filling in earlier attunement-chain bosses
  healers may still have logs for, not tracking new current content.
- **The local-scripting pipeline's first real production use (2026-07-15)**:
  report `LKbVcNfRxyBkj2mg` (12 real boss kills — the 10 usual SSC/TK bosses
  plus Maulgar and Gruul from the newly-added tier, all real kills, no wipes)
  was pulled, analyzed, and rendered end-to-end through
  `render_healer_report.ps1` for the first time ever on brand-new data (every
  prior real v2 site was hand-written by Claude — see "Local-scripting
  pipeline" above). **This is a shared raid log — both Danceswtrees (Druid,
  `data\Characters\Danceswtrees\LKbVcNfRxyBkj2mg\`) and Vajomee (Shaman,
  `data\Characters\Vajomee\LKbVcNfRxyBkj2mg\`) were pulled and rendered from
  this same report code the same day**, each with their own real
  `_analysis.json`/`_findings.json` and all 12 `docs\{healer}\LKbVcNfRxyBkj2mg\
  healer_audit_*.html` pages (confirmed on disk 2026-07-16, both hub pages
  link it) — this was not a Druid-only run. It was initially rendered and
  **published with `build_placeholder_findings.ps1`'s placeholder text still
  in it** — a real mistake, caught and fixed the same session by authoring a
  real `LKbVcNfRxyBkj2mg_findings.json` (for at least Danceswtrees; not
  independently reconfirmed whether Vajomee's findings.json went through the
  same placeholder-then-fix cycle) via the generate-healer-report skill and
  re-rendering. Two real, previously-undiscovered bugs surfaced during this
  first real run, both fixed and unlikely to be class- or report-specific:
  - **The raid overview's "bosses killed" line used to be a hardcoded
    `-TotalBosses`/`-BossesKilled` tier-size default (10 on both
    `render_healer_report.ps1` and `update_hub_pages.ps1`)** — broke the
    moment a report had more than 10 real bosses in it (rendered a
    nonsensical "12/10 bosses killed"). Fixed by deriving the denominator
    from each report's own real fight data instead: `build_boss_report_data.ps1`
    now writes a real `BossesAttempted` count to `report_data.json` (every
    real boss pull this report has, kill or wipe), and both rendering
    scripts only show a `<kills>/<attempted>` denominator when a real wipe is
    present in that specific report — otherwise it's just "`<N>` bosses
    killed". `-TotalBosses` is gone from both scripts; `update_hub_pages.ps1`
    takes an optional `-BossesAttempted` instead, only needed when a real
    wipe happened.
  - **OffHand(16) was wrongly in `ReportRenderLib.psm1`'s
    `$script:EnchantableSlotIndexes` allowlist**, flagging a real, permanent
    false-positive "missing enchant" gap on every report this pipeline has
    ever rendered — every tracked healer spec (Resto Druid, Resto Shaman,
    Holy Priest, Holy Paladin) holds a non-weapon "Held In Off-Hand" item
    there (an orb/tome/idol, confirmed live via the real gear.json icon
    `inv_misc_orb_01.jpg` on Danceswtrees's own report), and only an actual
    off-hand weapon or shield can carry a permanent enchant in this era — a
    caster off-hand item never can, full stop, regardless of what's actually
    equipped there. Removed from the allowlist entirely, same treatment as
    the existing ring exclusion (gotcha #6). **Not yet checked whether this
    false-positive already appears in any of the 4 hand-written real v2
    sites** (Danceswtrees/Vajomee/Lippies/Crowns's original pages predate the
    render pipeline and were never regenerated through it — see "Local-
    scripting pipeline" above) — worth a spot-check if a gear-audit accuracy
    pass is ever done on those.

**Explicitly open, in priority-ish order:**
1. Tranquility's guid is unknown/unobserved (Druid-only concept) —
   `$cooldownGuids["Tranquility"]` is an empty array in both Druid-touching
   scripts and will silently show 0 forever until someone adds the real guid once
   it's actually seen in a pull.
2. **Every class this project tracks (Druid, Shaman, Priest, Paladin) is now on
   the v2 pipeline** — there is no more "port a class" work left on the
   original four-class scope. If a fifth class is ever added, the playbook is
   proven four times over now: (a) a real-data discovery pass BEFORE writing any
   class-specific guid table (never assume a class's cooldown kit or
   self-buff-uptime concept from memory, and don't over-generalize a finding
   scoped to one character's report — check it against the full Top 100 sample
   before it goes into permanent documentation, see the Holy Shock finding
   above), (b) build the new pull script as a separate file modeled on the
   existing v2 scripts, smoke-test on one boss into a scratch folder, then
   promote, (c) add the class's entries to `build_boss_report_data.ps1`'s and
   `summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1`'s class-keyed tables, (d) build
   `boss_page_template_{class}.html` from the existing templates' section
   *shape*, not their specific content, (e) extend the generate-healer-report
   skill's class gate once proven end-to-end.
3. One narrow, accepted gap, reconfirmed with real Shaman, Priest, and Paladin
   data at a broadly similar rate: no `combatantinfo` snapshot even within the
   2-minute backward buffer, likely a late-joining player — 1 case for Druid
   (~0.1%), ~5 for Shaman (~0.5%), 11 for Priest (~1.1%), 11 for Paladin
   (~1.1%, matching Priest almost exactly) — currently just reported as a
   failure for that one player's consumables data, not chased further.
4. **Power Word: Shield's Top 100 benchmark is a real but misleading ~0%** (9 of
   10 bosses) — see the "v2" bullets above. Any coverage-note on a Priest boss
   page must name this caveat rather than reading it as a norm. `build_boss_analysis.ps1`
   auto-tags this as the `priest_pws_benchmark_bias` canned caveat (see
   "Local-scripting pipeline" above) for any report built through the new pipeline.
5. **Holy Shock's cast and heal use two different real guids** (33072 cast,
   33074 heal) — see the "v2" bullets above. Any coverage-note on a Paladin boss
   page must reflect this, not assume Holy Shock never heals. `build_boss_analysis.ps1`
   auto-tags this as the `paladin_holy_shock_guid_split` canned caveat for any
   report built through the new pipeline.
6. **Gruul's Lair/Magtheridon's Lair rollout has a real rendered report for
   Danceswtrees (Druid) AND Vajomee (Shaman) now — corrected 2026-07-16,
   see below.** Both were pulled/analyzed/rendered from the same shared raid
   log (report `LKbVcNfRxyBkj2mg`, see "Recently closed" above) the same day
   (2026-07-15); an earlier version of this file said the rollout was
   "Druid-only," which was checked against real files on disk (2026-07-16)
   and found to be wrong — Vajomee's `data\Characters\Vajomee\LKbVcNfRxyBkj2mg\`
   and `docs\vajomee\LKbVcNfRxyBkj2mg\` both exist in full (12 boss pages
   including Maulgar/Gruul, real findings.json, linked from Vajomee's hub
   page). **Lippies (Priest) and Crowns (Paladin) still only have their
   original `XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb` report on disk** (confirmed 2026-07-16, no
   second report-code folder exists for either) — they genuinely haven't had
   a new raid night generated since the tier was added. Nothing to migrate by
   hand for either — the next `generate-healer-report` run for them will pick
   up the new boss IDs automatically — but don't assume their sites already
   reflect this the way Danceswtrees's and Vajomee's now do. **Lesson from
   this correction: verify "which healers have X" claims against the actual
   report-code folders on disk before trusting this file's phrasing — a
   shared raid log means one pull session can silently cover more than one
   healer, and this file didn't say so the first time.**

## Ground rules (condensed from WORKFLOW.md — read the real thing for why)

- **Never fabricate or estimate a number that wasn't actually pulled.** If data is
  missing or a source is known-unreliable, say so explicitly rather than guessing or
  omitting silently.
- **No letter grades, ever** — percentile numbers only (gotcha #9). This was an
  explicit, deliberate design correction; don't reintroduce it.
- **Group by ability guid, never by display name** (gotcha #2) — names are localized
  per client. But also: **don't merge different guids that share a display name**
  without checking first (gotcha #20) — sometimes that's a real mechanical
  distinction (Lifebloom's HoT-tick vs. bloom-burst are different guids), not noise.
- **Test one real API call before building a pull script around an assumption** —
  this pattern (ask for one small diagnostic, read the real response, THEN write
  code) caught almost every bug in WORKFLOW.md's gotcha list. Don't skip it just
  because you can now run things yourself.
- **No gendered pronouns in any report/page prose** (added 2026-07-12) — refer to
  the healer by name (e.g. "Danceswtrees") or restructure the sentence, don't use
  "she/her/he/him". This crept in through free-form coverage-note writing (not the
  templates themselves, which never had this problem) on the first two real v2
  boss pages and had to be swept out after the fact — write clean the first time.
- **The v2 GraphQL API's rate limit resets on a rolling hourly clock, confirmed
  live 2026-07-12** — hit a real full lockout mid-session (a day of heavy pulling:
  a Danceswtrees re-pull, a Vajomee pull, a full Druid Top 100 pull, and two Shaman
  Top 100 pull attempts all in the same session) where even the lightweight
  `rateLimitData { pointsSpentThisHour pointsResetIn }` diagnostic query itself
  returned 429. Don't keep retrying a burst of 429s hoping it clears in a minute —
  check `rateLimitData.pointsResetIn` (when it isn't itself rate-limited) or just
  wait out the rest of the current clock hour before retrying a big pull. **Note:**
  a live check on 2026-07-13 (before the Priest Top 100 pull) showed
  `limitPerHour: 18000`, not the 3600 documented the day before — check the live
  value rather than trusting either number from memory, see WORKFLOW.md's "v2
  GraphQL API" section.
- **Never embed a literal non-ASCII character directly in a `.ps1`/`.psm1` file's
  source** (added 2026-07-14, generalizing gotcha #14's BOM/encoding class) —
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads its own source using the system default codepage
  when the file has no BOM, silently mangling any literal em-dash/arrow/middle-dot/
  etc. embedded in a string OR regex literal. Hit this twice for real, months
  apart: once in `ReportRenderLib.psm1` (broke the parser outright), once in
  `update_hub_pages.ps1`'s date-extraction regex (parsed silently but wrongly —
  every single existing raid-row failed to match its own date and sorted last).
  Always use `[char]0xNNNN` and interpolate instead — see either script for the
  pattern.
- **`data\Characters\`/`docs\` raid-night folders are keyed by WCL report code,
  not raid date** (added 2026-07-14, see "data\Characters\ and docs\ folders"
  above) — never assume or hardcode a `{yyyy-MM-dd}\` path for a NEW report; two
  raids on the same calendar date is a real scenario the old convention silently
  corrupted data for. `data\Classes\` (Top 100 benchmark data) is a completely
  separate model and is NOT affected by this — don't conflate the two.

## Hosting — GitHub Pages

The repo is already on GitHub: **`twiztid-ace/WC_log_analysis`** (public), default
branch **`master`** (not `main` — worth noting since that's the more common default
name now). The person manages it day-to-day through **SourceTree**, not the raw git
CLI.

**Git CLI is available even though it's not on PATH.** SourceTree bundles its own
git at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Atlassian\SourceTree\git_local\bin\git.exe`. Call it with a
full path (or `-C <repo-path>`) to inspect real repo state directly — confirmed
working:
```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Atlassian\SourceTree\git_local\bin\git.exe" -C "C:\Users\raymo\wc_logs" status
```
Prefer this over asking the person to run/paste git output, same reasoning as the
"you can do something I couldn't" section above. `apikey.txt` is confirmed **not**
tracked (`git ls-files` doesn't list it) — safe as long as `.gitignore` isn't
changed to drop that line.

**Chosen approach: separate code from the served static site using a `docs/`
folder**, not a dedicated `gh-pages` branch. GitHub Pages supports serving from
`/docs` on a normal branch (Settings → Pages → Source → Deploy from a branch →
`master` / `/docs`), which avoids juggling an orphan branch in a GUI client like
SourceTree — a plain commit+push to `docs/` is enough to publish, no branch
switching required.

**Migration done (2026-07-12), committed and pushed since.** The live v1 site
output (`index.html`, `crowns/`, `danceswtrees/`, `lippies/`, `vajomee/`) now
lives under `docs/` at repo root, moved as one whole tree (not piecemeal)
specifically so the pages' relative links (`../index.html`, etc.) kept resolving
correctly — spot-checked after the move: `docs/index.html`'s healer links,
`docs/danceswtrees/index.html`'s `../index.html` back-link, and its raid-date
subfolder link all still resolve. `scripts/`, `data/`, `templates/`,
`reference/`, `examples/`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TODO.md` stay at repo
root — Pages only serves what's inside `docs/`, so keeping them at root just
means they're not web-served (still visible in the repo browser itself, since
the repo is public — Pages scoping doesn't hide them, it just keeps them out of
the served site). This has since been committed and pushed to `master` via
SourceTree (confirmed by real commit history and by the live Pages site itself,
which can only be serving `docs/` content that's actually on `master`).

**One-time setup on github.com — done.** The GitHub Pages toggle has been
flipped (Settings → Pages → Source → "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: `master`,
folder: `/docs`), and the site is confirmed live: fetched
`https://twiztid-ace.github.io/WC_log_analysis/` directly on 2026-07-13 and it
serves the real homepage, listing all 4 healers (Crowns, Danceswtrees, Lippies,
Vajomee) with working links. It's a **project site**, served from a subpath, not
domain root — no accidentally-absolute-link problems observed, consistent with
the site's relative-link convention.

**Ongoing publish workflow:** regenerate/edit the static pages under `docs/`,
commit, push via SourceTree — GitHub rebuilds Pages automatically (typically
under a minute), no separate build step, since this has always been plain
static HTML/CSS with no bundler.

**Status: folder migration done, Pages toggle flipped, site confirmed live.**
Any future doc-audit should still re-check the live URL rather than trust this
line indefinitely — hosting config is a real, external piece of state this file
can't observe automatically.

**A second, later folder rename (2026-07-14) changed every existing raid
night's URL** — see "data\Characters\ and docs\ folders — report code, not raid
date" above. E.g. `https://twiztid-ace.github.io/WC_log_analysis/crowns/2026-07-07/`
became `.../crowns/XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb/`. This was a deliberate, one-time fix for a
real data-corruption bug (see that section), not something to undo, but it does
mean any bookmark/external link to an old date-based URL now 404s — not
verified against the live site after this specific rename at the time this note
was written; re-check the live URLs if that matters for a given task.
