# ATNF Healer Analysis — Claude Code orientation

This is a WoW Classic (TBC/SSC-TK era) raid healer analysis pipeline: pull real combat
log data from Warcraft Logs, benchmark it against Top 100 parses, and generate
a static HTML site auditing each healer's performance per boss kill. All four Fresh
SSC/TK healer classes' pipelines (`pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1` — shared/class-agnostic —,
`pull_top100_druid.ps1`, `pull_top100_shaman.ps1`, `pull_top100_priest_holy.ps1`,
`pull_top100_paladin.ps1`) now pull that data via WCL's **v2 GraphQL API** (Druid
migrated 2026-07-12, Shaman ported the same day as its own "Phase 3" pilot, Priest
ported 2026-07-13, Paladin ported the same day right after Priest — see WORKFLOW.md's
"v2 GraphQL API" section). No class remains on the original v1 REST API.

**Read `WORKFLOW.md` first, in full, before touching anything.** It is the single
source of truth for this project — API endpoints, file formats, known bugs, and 33
numbered "gotchas" documenting real mistakes already made and fixed. Assume anything
not in WORKFLOW.md is unverified. This file is just a map to get you oriented quickly;
WORKFLOW.md has the actual depth.

## You can do something I (this conversation's Claude) couldn't

This whole project was built through a text-based chat where I could never execute
PowerShell myself — every script had to be handed to the person to run, with results
pasted back as text before I could react. That was slow and error-prone (see gotcha
#19 in WORKFLOW.md for a bug that only got caught because of exactly this friction).

**You're running in an environment with real command execution.** Actually run the
`.ps1` scripts. Actually inspect the JSON output files directly instead of asking the
person to paste console output. This should make you meaningfully more effective at
catching bugs than I was — use that.

One catch: these scripts are Windows PowerShell 5.1-specific in places (see gotcha
#13 on `-UseBasicParsing`, gotcha #14 on BOM/encoding issues, gotcha #19 on the
`if/else` array-collapse bug). If you're not running on Windows, don't assume they'll
behave identically on PowerShell 7+/pwsh on Linux/Mac — test before trusting.

## Two generations of this pipeline — don't confuse them

This project has a **simple v1** (already shipped, live on 4 healer sites) and an
**enhanced v2** (Druid and Shaman as of 2026-07-12, Priest and Paladin as of
2026-07-13 — every class this project tracks is now on the v2 methodology).
Reading the repo cold, both look like "real output" — they're not at the same
maturity, and mixing them up is the main way to get confused here.

**Naming collision to watch for:** this "v1/v2" is about *methodology* (simple
gear-check vs. events-based enhanced pipeline) — a completely different axis from
the WCL "v1 REST API / v2 GraphQL API" distinction mentioned above. All four
classes are now on methodology-v2 AND API-v2 — the two axes never actually
diverged for any class ported so far (Shaman, Priest, and Paladin all went from
v1/v1 straight to v2/v2 in one pass, same as Druid's own history), so this
project still hasn't seen a *partial* port (e.g. API-only migration without the
events-based rewrite) that would actually split the two axes apart for one
class. Don't assume "v2" means the same thing in every sentence of this file or
WORKFLOW.md without checking which axis it's on.

- **v1 (simple)**: gear check + basic spell composition + a couple of other checks,
  built on the old `/report/tables/` healing view (5-entry truncation bug and all —
  see WORKFLOW.md gotcha #4/#15). This is what produced the 4 fully-built healer
  sites currently sitting at the repo root (`crowns/`, `danceswtrees/`, `lippies/`,
  `vajomee/`, plus the root `index.html` homepage). Treat these as a finished
  snapshot of the *old* methodology, not a template for new output — regenerating
  them with the v2 pipeline is future work, not done per healer (see "Current
  state" for which healers already have a real v2 site).
- **v2 (enhanced)**: events-based healing/casts (no truncation), cooldown/utility
  tracking with self-vs-other targets (Druid: Innervate/Nature's Swiftness/
  Swiftmend/Rebirth/Dark Rune, real buff uptime via Tree of Life interval
  reconstruction; Shaman: Earth Shield/Mana Tide Totem/Ancestral Swiftness/Dark
  Rune; Priest: Shadowfiend/Power Word: Shield/Chakra/Blessing of Life/Fear Ward/
  Dark Rune; Paladin: Holy Shock/Divine Favor/Divine Shield/Cleanse/Hand of
  Protection/Blessing of Freedom/Dark Rune — no Rebirth-equivalent or
  self-buff-uptime concept exists for Shaman, Priest, OR Paladin in this TBC
  ruleset, confirmed against real data for all three, not assumed), Top 100
  benchmarking, CSV summarization. **Resto Druid, Resto Shaman, Holy Priest, and
  Holy Paladin** all have this now (see "Current state" below). Three full v2
  healer sites have been generated end-to-end (Danceswtrees/Druid,
  Vajomee/Shaman, and Lippies/Priest) — Paladin's Top 100 pipeline is wired up
  but a full Crowns site regen hasn't been done yet (see "Current state").
  `examples/` has one older reference page but it's out of date (see below).

## Data model — active/archived + manifest.json (all four classes now)

Replaced the old "fresh date-stamped folder every pull" convention for Druid on
2026-07-12, because that convention re-fetched all ~1,000 Top 100 parses from the
WCL API on every single run even though the vast majority don't change between
runs and a completed log's data can never change once pulled. Shaman was built
directly on this model from day one when it was ported the same day, Priest the
same way again on 2026-07-13, and Paladin the same way again right after Priest
(no old date-folder data existed worth migrating forward for any of the three —
see WORKFLOW.md's "v2 GraphQL API" section for why). Full design rationale,
manifest schema, and the exact diff algorithm are in WORKFLOW.md's
"Active/archived data model" section — read that before touching any pull
script. The short version:
- `data\Classes\{Druid,Shaman,Priest,Paladin}\manifest.json` tracks per-boss
  `lastPulledDate`/`rankingsSnapshotDate` and per-parse `active`/`archived` status.
- `active\` holds only what's currently in a boss's Top 100. `archived\` holds
  everything that's ever dropped out, kept forever, never deleted.
- Staleness is always a plain `yyyy-MM-dd` date compared to today at read time —
  never a stored boolean (see WORKFLOW.md for why that matters).
- **No class remains on the old date-folder convention as of Paladin's port.**
  The old convention is documented in WORKFLOW.md purely as reference for a
  hypothetical future new class.

Not included here (repo-specific, never shared in the source conversation):
`apikey.txt` (gitignored, v1 REST API key — no longer used by any currently-active
pull script, kept only for the preserved `*_v1.ps1` reference scripts),
`v2_client_id.txt`/`v2_client_secret.txt`/`v2_access_token.txt` (gitignored, v2
GraphQL OAuth credentials used by `WclV2Api.psm1`, now shared by
`pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1` and all four `pull_top100_*.ps1` scripts),
`.gitignore`.

## Current state — what's solid vs. what's open

**v1 (simple) — shipped, and superseded per class as v2 lands:**
- 4 healer sites' worth of v1 pages still exist (`crowns/`, `danceswtrees/`,
  `lippies/`, `vajomee/` under `docs/`), each with all 10 SSC/TK boss kills for
  one raid night. This is the old gear-check + basic-spell-composition
  methodology — not being extended further, kept only as historical reference
  now that all four classes have a v2 pipeline. Danceswtrees's and Lippies's own
  v1 pages have already been superseded by real v2 pages for the same raid night
  (moved aside to a `-v1`/`_v1`-suffixed sibling folder, not deleted); Crowns's
  and Vajomee's v1 pages are still live pending their own v2 regen (Vajomee's
  Top 100 data is v2, but no full site regen has been run for her yet either —
  don't assume "class is v2" means "this healer's site is v2").
- `data\Classes\{Shaman,Priest,Paladin}\2026-07-10\` (or 2026-07-07, check the
  actual folder) still exist as the old v1-generation Top 100 pulls, preserved
  untouched on disk, same convention as keeping `*_v1.ps1` scripts around — none
  of these are the active data for their class anymore, superseded by the v2
  ports below.

**v2 (enhanced) — Druid, Shaman, Priest, and Paladin — all four classes now:**
- `pull_character_TEMPLATE.ps1` (shared/class-agnostic) and `pull_top100_druid.ps1`
  were migrated from the v1 REST API to the v2 GraphQL API on 2026-07-12 (this was
  originally just meant to fix a null-percentile bug — v1's percentile endpoints
  are structurally incapable of returning an exact report+fight match — but the
  fix was expanded to a full API migration once the root cause was understood).
  `pull_top100_shaman.ps1` was ported the same day, as the "Phase 3" pilot class
  for extending this same v2 architecture beyond Druid; `pull_top100_priest_holy.ps1`
  followed the next day (2026-07-13); `pull_top100_paladin.ps1` followed the same
  day right after Priest — all three modeled directly on `pull_top100_druid.ps1`
  since none of the old v1 scripts shared much structurally with it (sequential,
  single healing-TABLE-per-parse, no casts/consumables/activetime/deaths at
  all). All five scripts were equivalence/smoke tested against real data before
  the old v1-API versions were preserved as `*_v1.ps1` and the new versions
  promoted to the production filenames. Full mapping/rationale for all four
  ported classes in WORKFLOW.md's "v2 GraphQL API" section (the durable copy —
  plan files are session-scoped working documents, and the plan file at
  `C:\Users\raymo\.claude\plans\playful-baking-sunset.md` holds only the Shaman
  port's own plan; neither the Priest nor the Paladin port had a separate plan
  file). **No class uses the v1 REST API or `apikey.txt` anymore.**
- Pipeline validated end to end on real data for all four classes: events-based
  healing/casts (no truncation), cooldown/utility tracking with self-vs-other
  targets (Druid: Innervate/Nature's Swiftness/Swiftmend/Rebirth/Dark Rune with
  real Tree of Life buff uptime; Shaman: Earth Shield/Mana Tide Totem/Ancestral
  Swiftness/Dark Rune, confirmed against a real Vajomee report; Priest:
  Shadowfiend/Power Word: Shield/Chakra/Blessing of Life/Fear Ward/Dark Rune,
  confirmed against a real Lippies report; Paladin: Holy Shock/Divine Favor/
  Divine Shield/Cleanse/Hand of Protection/Blessing of Freedom/Dark Rune,
  confirmed against a real Crowns report — no Rebirth-equivalent or
  self-buff-uptime concept exists for Shaman, Priest, OR Paladin in this TBC
  ruleset), each class's own boss page template.
- All **10 of 10 bosses** pulled and confirmed on disk for Druid
  (`data\Classes\Druid\active\`, 1,000 parses), Shaman
  (`data\Classes\Shaman\active\`, ~995/1,000 — a handful of parses hit the known
  ~0.5% combatantinfo-snapshot gap, see item 3 below), Priest
  (`data\Classes\Priest\active\`, 989/1,000 — 11 failed, same gap, ~1.1%), and
  Paladin (`data\Classes\Paladin\active\`, **989/1,000** — 11 failed, same gap,
  ~1.1%, matching Priest's rate almost exactly). All four use the same
  RunspacePool + active/archived + `manifest.json` model — see "Data model"
  below. **Verify boss/parse counts against `manifest.json` or the actual folder
  before trusting a number someone recalls from memory** — this has drifted from
  reality before.
- `summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1` has been run against all four classes' full
  active sets — all four `benchmark_*.csv` files exist for each in their own
  `data\Classes\{Class}\active\`. Its cooldown-guid table and Tree-of-Life buff
  column were made class-keyed while porting Shaman and extended again for
  Priest and then Paladin (previously a single flat, ungated Druid-only table
  that would have silently miscomputed cooldown numbers for any other class —
  see WORKFLOW.md gotcha #29/#30 area).
- **Real finding from the Priest benchmark run**: Power Word: Shield's
  `Top100UsedPct` in `benchmark_cooldowns.csv` is ~0% on 9 of 10 bosses (1% on
  Kael'thas) — verified not a bug despite Lippies herself casting it 8 times in
  her own raid night; the benchmark population is systematically biased away
  from this ability by the HPS ranking metric, not reflecting a real "norm." Any
  Priest boss page must not read a real character's Shield usage as "overusing"
  it relative to this benchmark.
- **Real finding from the Paladin benchmark run, corrected after checking the
  full Top 100 sample**: Holy Shock's cast (guid 33072) and its resulting heal
  are logged under two DIFFERENT real guids, not one — the heal lands under
  guid 33074, also named "Holy Shock." The first draft of this finding (scoped
  only to Crowns's own report) claimed Holy Shock "doesn't itself heal," which
  turned out to be too broad — the wider Top 100 sample shows real players
  landing real Holy Shock heals (guid 33074) worth 0.6-1.7% of total healing on
  several bosses; Crowns's own 8 real casts this raid simply never happened to
  land one. Corrected in `pull_top100_paladin.ps1`'s header,
  `build_boss_report_data.ps1`'s and `summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1`'s
  comments, and `boss_page_template_paladin.html`'s guidance before this ever
  reached a real generated page — see WORKFLOW.md's "v2 GraphQL API" section
  for the full writeup and the lesson it draws (a discovery pass scoped to one
  character's report needs checking against the full Top 100 sample before a
  "never does X" claim goes into permanent documentation).
- Three full v2 healer sites have been generated end-to-end: Danceswtrees/Druid
  (`docs\danceswtrees\2026-06-30\`), Vajomee/Shaman (`docs\vajomee\2026-07-10\`),
  and Lippies/Priest (`docs\lippies\2026-07-07\`) — each a real raid overview +
  one page per boss kill, built from real `build_boss_report_data.ps1` output,
  not templated filler. **Paladin's Top 100 pipeline (pull + benchmark +
  template) is now wired up the same way, but a full Crowns site regen has NOT
  been done yet** — this is a real, separate next step (see "Explicitly open"
  below), not implied by the pull script being ready.

**Explicitly open, in priority-ish order:**
1. Tranquility's guid is unknown/unobserved (Druid-only concept) —
   `$cooldownGuids["Tranquility"]` is an empty array in both Druid-touching
   scripts and will silently show 0 forever until someone adds the real guid once
   it's actually seen in a pull.
2. **A full Crowns v2 site regen hasn't been done yet.** Paladin's Top 100
   pipeline is fully ported and proven (pull + benchmark + template), but nobody
   has run `build_boss_report_data.ps1` + the generate-healer-report skill
   against Crowns's real report (`XJp8vAxzM4KtHYyb`) to produce a real v2 raid
   overview + 10 boss pages the way Danceswtrees/Vajomee/Lippies already have.
   This is the natural next step now that the pipeline itself is ready — and,
   with it done, every one of the 4 existing healer sites would have a real v2
   version.
3. **Every class this project tracks (Druid, Shaman, Priest, Paladin) is now on
   the v2 pipeline** — there is no more "port a class" work left on the
   original four-class scope. If a fifth class is ever added, the playbook is
   proven four times over now: (a) a real-data discovery pass BEFORE writing any
   class-specific guid table (never assume a class's cooldown kit or
   self-buff-uptime concept from memory, and don't over-generalize a finding
   scoped to one character's report — check it against the full Top 100 sample
   before it goes into permanent documentation, see the Holy Shock finding
   above), (b) build the new pull script as a separate file modeled on the
   existing v2 scripts, smoke-test on one boss into a scratch folder, then
   promote, (c) add the class's entries to `build_boss_report_data.ps1`'s and
   `summarize_class_benchmarks.ps1`'s class-keyed tables, (d) build
   `boss_page_template_{class}.html` from the existing templates' section
   *shape*, not their specific content, (e) extend the generate-healer-report
   skill's class gate once proven end-to-end.
4. One narrow, accepted gap, reconfirmed with real Shaman, Priest, and Paladin
   data at a broadly similar rate: no `combatantinfo` snapshot even within the
   2-minute backward buffer, likely a late-joining player — 1 case for Druid
   (~0.1%), ~5 for Shaman (~0.5%), 11 for Priest (~1.1%), 11 for Paladin
   (~1.1%, matching Priest almost exactly) — currently just reported as a
   failure for that one player's consumables data, not chased further.
5. **Power Word: Shield's Top 100 benchmark is a real but misleading ~0%** (9 of
   10 bosses) — see the "v2" bullets above. Any coverage-note on a Priest boss
   page must name this caveat rather than reading it as a norm.
6. **Holy Shock's cast and heal use two different real guids** (33072 cast,
   33074 heal) — see the "v2" bullets above. Any coverage-note on a Paladin boss
   page must reflect this, not assume Holy Shock never heals.

## Ground rules (condensed from WORKFLOW.md — read the real thing for why)

- **Never fabricate or estimate a number that wasn't actually pulled.** If data is
  missing or a source is known-unreliable, say so explicitly rather than guessing or
  omitting silently.
- **No letter grades, ever** — percentile numbers only (gotcha #9). This was an
  explicit, deliberate design correction; don't reintroduce it.
- **Group by ability guid, never by display name** (gotcha #2) — names are localized
  per client. But also: **don't merge different guids that share a display name**
  without checking first (gotcha #20) — sometimes that's a real mechanical
  distinction (Lifebloom's HoT-tick vs. bloom-burst are different guids), not noise.
- **Test one real API call before building a pull script around an assumption** —
  this pattern (ask for one small diagnostic, read the real response, THEN write
  code) caught almost every bug in WORKFLOW.md's gotcha list. Don't skip it just
  because you can now run things yourself.
- **No gendered pronouns in any report/page prose** (added 2026-07-12) — refer to
  the healer by name (e.g. "Danceswtrees") or restructure the sentence, don't use
  "she/her/he/him". This crept in through free-form coverage-note writing (not the
  templates themselves, which never had this problem) on the first two real v2
  boss pages and had to be swept out after the fact — write clean the first time.
- **The v2 GraphQL API's rate limit resets on a rolling hourly clock, confirmed
  live 2026-07-12** — hit a real full lockout mid-session (a day of heavy pulling:
  a Danceswtrees re-pull, a Vajomee pull, a full Druid Top 100 pull, and two Shaman
  Top 100 pull attempts all in the same session) where even the lightweight
  `rateLimitData { pointsSpentThisHour pointsResetIn }` diagnostic query itself
  returned 429. Don't keep retrying a burst of 429s hoping it clears in a minute —
  check `rateLimitData.pointsResetIn` (when it isn't itself rate-limited) or just
  wait out the rest of the current clock hour before retrying a big pull. **Note:**
  a live check on 2026-07-13 (before the Priest Top 100 pull) showed
  `limitPerHour: 18000`, not the 3600 documented the day before — check the live
  value rather than trusting either number from memory, see WORKFLOW.md's "v2
  GraphQL API" section.

## Hosting — GitHub Pages

The repo is already on GitHub: **`twiztid-ace/WC_log_analysis`** (public), default
branch **`master`** (not `main` — worth noting since that's the more common default
name now). The person manages it day-to-day through **SourceTree**, not the raw git
CLI.

**Git CLI is available even though it's not on PATH.** SourceTree bundles its own
git at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Atlassian\SourceTree\git_local\bin\git.exe`. Call it with a
full path (or `-C <repo-path>`) to inspect real repo state directly — confirmed
working:
```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Atlassian\SourceTree\git_local\bin\git.exe" -C "C:\Users\raymo\wc_logs" status
```
Prefer this over asking the person to run/paste git output, same reasoning as the
"you can do something I couldn't" section above. `apikey.txt` is confirmed **not**
tracked (`git ls-files` doesn't list it) — safe as long as `.gitignore` isn't
changed to drop that line.

**Chosen approach: separate code from the served static site using a `docs/`
folder**, not a dedicated `gh-pages` branch. GitHub Pages supports serving from
`/docs` on a normal branch (Settings → Pages → Source → Deploy from a branch →
`master` / `/docs`), which avoids juggling an orphan branch in a GUI client like
SourceTree — a plain commit+push to `docs/` is enough to publish, no branch
switching required.

**Migration done (2026-07-12).** The live v1 site output (`index.html`, `crowns/`,
`danceswtrees/`, `lippies/`, `vajomee/`) now lives under `docs/` at repo root,
moved as one whole tree (not piecemeal) specifically so the pages' relative links
(`../index.html`, etc.) kept resolving correctly — spot-checked after the move:
`docs/index.html`'s healer links, `docs/danceswtrees/index.html`'s `../index.html`
back-link, and its raid-date subfolder link all still resolve. `scripts/`, `data/`,
`templates/`, `reference/`, `examples/`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TODO.md` stay
at repo root — Pages only serves what's inside `docs/`, so keeping them at root
just means they're not web-served (still visible in the repo browser itself, since
the repo is public — Pages scoping doesn't hide them, it just keeps them out of
the served site). This was a working-tree-only change — nothing staged/committed,
that's still the person's to do via SourceTree.

**Still open — one-time setup on github.com (not doable via git/API from here):**
1. Confirm repo visibility: Settings → General → Danger Zone → should already say
   Public.
2. Once the `docs/` migration is committed/pushed to `master`: Settings → Pages →
   Source → "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: `master`, folder: `/docs` → Save.
   **Not done yet** — the folder move is real, but the GitHub Pages toggle itself
   hasn't been flipped, so nothing is actually being served yet.
3. Resulting URL: `https://twiztid-ace.github.io/WC_log_analysis/` — a **project
   site**, served from a subpath, not domain root. Smoke-test the first deploy
   specifically for any accidentally-absolute (`/index.html`-style) links; the
   site already uses relative links throughout per WORKFLOW.md's zip-delivery
   convention, so this should already be fine, but hasn't been verified live.

**Ongoing publish workflow once set up:** regenerate/edit the static pages under
`docs/`, commit, push via SourceTree — GitHub rebuilds Pages automatically
(typically under a minute), no separate build step, since this has always been
plain static HTML/CSS with no bundler.

**Status: folder migration done, Pages toggle still not flipped.** The GitHub
Pages setting itself is a real, visible change (exposes a public URL) — confirm
before flipping it on github.com rather than assuming this documentation update
means it's live.
